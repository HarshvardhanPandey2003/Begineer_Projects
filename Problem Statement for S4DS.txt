Problem Statement: Predictive Maintenance for Solar Power Plants

Problem Description: Solar power plants play a crucial role in green energy production,
 but their efficiency is hampered due to unseen maintance issues and problems in the given features 
.This model will ensure predicting which solar panels need eary routine checkup than normally assigned
 time and what factors can change go increase the life of our solar panels 

Solution Requirements:

Features : Name_of_the_buyer , Price , Installation_Date , Company_Name , Area , Energy_consumed_per_day , 
Defect_Type , Date_when_defect_occured , weather , Temprature , time_of_routine_inspection , Additional info

Role of Supervised Learning : Build a predictive model that uses historical data on solar panel health and 
includes the listed features which will be used to classify panels as healthy or at risk of failure. 
The model should provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a panel failure 

Role of Unsupervised Learning : Use unsupervised clustering techniques to identify patterns in sensor data 
from the solar panels. Discover hidden relations between mutiple features that might indicate problems occuring 
in the future by using scatter plot and algorithms like Kmeans Clustering 

Role of Natural Language Processing : By the information in Additional Info coloumn we can gain some more insights to make our predictive model 
more accurate by indentifying the specific problems if the problem occured due to some storm or birds hit the solar panel or any other reason

Comibination : Combine the results of the supervised , unsupervised learning models and NLP to create a wholesome approach maintenance strategy.

Time series analysis for Real time evaluation : Develop a system that continuously monitors sensor data in real time and updates 
the predictive models accordingly. This should enable timely adjustments to maintenance schedules and prevent unexpected downtime.

Dataset: Participants will be provided with historical sensor data from multiple solar panels, maintenance records and historical weather conditions
